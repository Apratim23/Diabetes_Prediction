# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview
This project is a machine learning application designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health-related features. The model leverages a dataset containing medical records to make accurate predictions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, normalizes data, and splits it into training and testing sets.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implements classification models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machines.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluates model accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- **User Interface:** (Optional) A simple UI for users to input data and get predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
  - Scikit-learn for machine learning
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
  - Flask or Streamlit for web interface (if applicable)

## Dataset
The project uses a publicly available diabetes dataset (e.g., from the [Kaggle Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)) which includes the following features:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/diabetes-prediction.git
   cd diabetes-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Run the project:**
   ```bash
   python src/app.py
   ```

2. **Access the web interface (if implemented):**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.

3. **Input Data:**
   Provide the necessary inputs, such as glucose levels, BMI, and age, to get a diabetes prediction.

## Results
The model achieves a performance of approximately XX% accuracy (adjust based on your results). For detailed metrics, refer to the `data_analysis.ipynb` notebook.
